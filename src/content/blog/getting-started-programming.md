**VS Code** (Recommended for beginners)
- Free and powerful
- Excellent extensions
- Built-in terminal
- Great debugging tools

**Alternatives:**
- Sublime Text
- Atom
- PyCharm (for Python)

### 2. Install Your Programming Language

#### For Python:
1. Download from [python.org](https://python.org)
2. Install with default settings
3. Verify installation: `python --version`

#### For JavaScript:
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. This includes npm (package manager)
3. Verify: `node --version`

### 3. Learn Version Control (Git)
- Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
- Create a GitHub account
- Learn basic commands: `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`

## Your First Program: "Hello, World!"

Let's write your first program in Python:

```python
# This is your first Python program!
print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to programming!")

# Variables
name = "Your Name"
age = 20
print(f"Hi, I'm {name} and I'm {age} years old.")

# Simple calculation
x = 10
y = 5
result = x + y
print(f"{x} + {y} = {result}")
```

**What this program does:**
1. Prints messages to the screen
2. Uses variables to store data
3. Performs basic arithmetic
4. Uses string formatting

## Fundamental Programming Concepts

### 1. Variables and Data Types
```python
# Numbers
age = 21
height = 5.8

# Strings
name = "Alice"
message = "Hello, World!"

# Booleans
is_student = True
has_laptop = False

# Lists
hobbies = ["coding", "reading", "gaming"]
```

### 2. Control Structures

#### If Statements
```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You're an adult!")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You're a teenager!")
else:
    print("You're a child!")
```

#### Loops
```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Count: {i}")

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(f"Loop iteration: {count}")
    count += 1
```

### 3. Functions
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Using functions
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)

result = add_numbers(10, 5)
print(f"10 + 5 = {result}")
```

## Building Your First Real Project

Let's create a simple **To-Do List** application:

```python
# Simple To-Do List Application
tasks = []

def show_menu():
    print("\n--- To-Do List ---")
    print("1. Add task")
    print("2. View tasks")
    print("3. Mark task as complete")
    print("4. Delete task")
    print("5. Exit")

def add_task():
    task = input("Enter a new task: ")
    tasks.append({"task": task, "completed": False})
    print(f"Task '{task}' added!")

def view_tasks():
    if not tasks:
        print("No tasks yet!")
        return
    
    print("\nYour tasks:")
    for i, task in enumerate(tasks, 1):
        status = "✓" if task["completed"] else "○"
        print(f"{i}. {status} {task['task']}")

def mark_complete():
    view_tasks()
    if tasks:
        try:
            index = int(input("Enter task number to mark complete: ")) - 1
            tasks[index]["completed"] = True
            print("Task marked as complete!")
        except (ValueError, IndexError):
            print("Invalid task number!")

# Main program loop
while True:
    show_menu()
    choice = input("Choose an option (1-5): ")
    
    if choice == "1":
        add_task()
    elif choice == "2":
        view_tasks()
    elif choice == "3":
        mark_complete()
    elif choice == "5":
        print("Goodbye!")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice!")
```
